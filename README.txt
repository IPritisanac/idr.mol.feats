Classes for calculation of molecular features from protein IDR sequence data 

- Parser class (myparser.py) - parses input_file.txt 
- input_file.txt -  lists parameters/parameter files
- Alignment class (run_feats.py) - reads in and process IDR alignment sequences
- Features class (sequence_features.py) - contains methods that compute molecular features from sequence files
